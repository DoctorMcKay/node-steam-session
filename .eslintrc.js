		// We will NOT be using eqeqeq for a few reasons:
		//  1. I'm only using ESLint to enforce style, not actual differences in functionality. ==/=== is not merely a style choice.
		//       Yes, I know that 'no-var' is actually enforcing a difference in functionality, but in practice nobody uses
		//       (or even knows about) var's hoisting functionality, so at this point it's effectively a style choice.
		//  2. A lot of the time, you actually *want* loose equality checks, especially when interacting with a web server
		//       (as HTTP as no concept of anything but strings). Yes, most of our interaction is JSON, but not all. And even then,
		//       not all JSON actually serializes numbers as numbers.
		//  3. `==` is really nowhere near as dangerous as memes would lead you to believe, if you know what you're doing.
		//  4. If the idea behind enforcing `===` is to prevent inexperienced developers from unwittingly introducing bugs
		//       via loose quality checks, in my opinion it could be just as harmful to instruct a code quality tool to
		//       naively demand that all `==` become `===`. If a developer were to build code that works, but upon opening
		//       a pull request they see that ESLint demands they use `===` instead, they might just click "fix" and resubmit,
		//       expecting the code quality tool to know what it's doing. But it *doesn't* know what it's doing, since it's
		//       just blindly alerting when it sees `==`. The change in functionality from `==` to `===` could very well
		//       introduce a bug by itself.
